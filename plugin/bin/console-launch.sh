# Pre/PostToolUse(Agent) launcher for the Team8.
#
# CONTRACT: PreToolUse BLOCKS the tool call, so this must never emit a
# permissionDecision and must always exit 0 — a broken console must never
# stop a teammate from spawning. On every path stdout is either `{}` or
# `{"systemMessage": ...}`, nothing else.
#
# PreToolUse fires before the teammate exists, so config.json cannot yet
# carry it — the member-count gate used to require a spawn that already
# happened. Instead this wakes on PreToolUse only when tool_input.name is a
# non-empty string, which the Agent tool sets only when routing to the
# teammate path (verified empirically: ordinary subagents and workflow
# fan-outs pass no name). PostToolUse keeps the old member-count gate as a
# safety net for when the Pre path fails to fire or fails to parse; the
# once-per-team marker file below makes sure only one of the two announces.

# Resolve the team this session belongs to, in order of preference:
#   1. A team whose config.json already names this session as leadSessionId.
#   2. `/branch` gives the forked session a brand new id but never touches
#      config.json, so a forked session's real team is keyed on an ANCESTOR's
#      id. Walk forkedFrom.sessionId up from this session's own transcript,
#      retrying (1) at each ancestor, until one resolves or the chain runs out.
#   3. A teammate's own .meta.json sidecar, which carries `teamName`. This is
#      the only resolution that survives a RE-KEY: Claude Code renames a team
#      the moment it spawns its first teammate, and the new config.json's
#      leadSessionId is a fresh id that belongs to no session at all, so (1)
#      and (2) both come up empty from then on.
#   4. The newest team on THIS cwd with a real roster. Sidecars have been seen
#      landing 22-33s after the transcript, and the team directory exists long
#      before that; members[] carries each member's cwd, so a team rooted in
#      our own project is ours in every case but two teams in one directory.
#   5. "session-<first 8 of our id>", but ONLY if that directory exists. This
#      was the original derivation and is still correct for a team that has not
#      been re-keyed; it is used as evidence now, never as a guess.
#   6. Nothing resolved — this session is about to create its FIRST team, or
#      CLAUDE_DIR is unreadable. Say so by leaving the name EMPTY rather than
#      deriving "session-<short id>": that derivation named a directory that
#      has never existed since teams began being re-keyed, and a console
#      started on it showed an empty wall. With no name the server discovers
#      the team itself, and follows the real one the moment it appears.
