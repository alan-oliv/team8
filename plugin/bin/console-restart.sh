# CONTRACT: always exit 0, and never write to stdout or stderr. This runs from
# a hook on every event the console misses, and Claude Code renders anything a
# hook writes to stderr as a "<hook name> hook error" notice — the very notice
# routing observation through curl exists to remove. Printing here would put
# the connection refusal back on the operator's screen once per tool call.
#
# The caller invokes this on ANY failed POST, not only a refused connection, so
# every gate below has to hold for a server that is merely slow as well as one
# that is gone.
