Read enough to be accurate and specific, and do not guess:
- README and any top-level docs
- manifests (package.json, pyproject.toml, mix.exs, Cargo.toml, go.mod, requirements.txt)
- the top two levels of the directory tree
- the last ~20 commits (git log --oneline -20) and the current branch, if it is a git repo
- if it is not a git repo, say so rather than inventing history

Return exactly five lines, each one sentence, covering in this order:
1. What the project is and what problem it solves.
2. Language, framework and key dependencies.
3. How the code is organised — the main directories or modules and how they fit together.
4. Current state: activity level, recent commit themes, branch, and whether it looks maintained or dormant.
5. One concrete, non-obvious detail a new contributor would want to know.

Be specific to this repo — name real files, real directories, real dependencies. No filler, no marketing tone. Do not include bullet markers or numbering in the line text.`,
