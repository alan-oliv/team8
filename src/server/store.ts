 * reaches that batch, so nothing before it can ever be read again. The second

 * restart: measured over five successive boots against 11 unchanged 2,000-record
 * transcripts, the log reaches a fixed point (105 rows, 6.9 MB) instead of

 *
 * The budget is spent WITHIN a row too, not only between rows: this ingest
 * batches at 200 records, but migrateLegacyLog recovers rows from a pre-batching
 * events.db verbatim, and that ingest put a whole 2,000-record file in one. A
 * row bigger than the remaining budget is kept as a bounded copy of its newest
 * records instead of being admitted whole.
 *
 * COST IS CARRIED, NEVER DROPPED. project() reads an agent's spend from the
 * newest transcript row that carries a cumulative `totals`, and falls back to
 * summing the records it holds when there is none. So before this drops
 * anything of an agent's, it makes sure the number project() would report
 * SURVIVES: the winning snapshot is copied onto the newest surviving row when
 * the row it sat on is going, and an agent that has no snapshot at all gets one
 * derived from the records about to go — the same sum project() would have
 * done. Bounding records then costs history and never money, which is what lets
 * the bound apply to every agent instead of exempting the ones a snapshot never
 * reached (a log older than `totals`, or an agent whose transcript file is gone).
