 * The switcher a sub-agents session offers. Straight off the canvas, which
 * builds it as `saViews: [['stream','stream'], ['trace','trace']]` — TWO pills,
 * against the team bar's seven and the workflow bar's five.
 *
 * `wall` is the first pill and LABELS itself `stream`: a single column already
 * is the parent's stream, so the id, route and component are unchanged.
 *
 * `trace` is offered only when its subject exists. The canvas has no artboard
 * for a session with no subagents at all — its `SESSIONS` fixture knows exactly
 * three kinds, `teammates`, `subagents` and `workflow` — so a bare window
 * getting `stream` alone is our own gap-fill, following the same rule.
 *
 * This REPLACES decision 24's four-pill list, which added `tasks` and `usage`
 * from the README's prose. `saViews` is the canvas's own answer and it outranks
 * the prose. The cost is real and was 24's whole argument: 9 of the 10 non-empty
 * task lists on that machine belonged to sessions rather than teams, and they
 * are no longer reachable from a solo session's switcher.
 *
 * `overview` is the one addition to `saViews`, and it is not a re-litigation of
 * that: when the canvas drew the solo switcher, overview WAS the wall condensed,
 * and condensing one column produces the column. Screen 8 replaced it with a
 * written brief, WHERE IT STANDS and a row — none of which need a second agent
 * to mean something. A solo session gets the same reading of its own transcript
 * that a team gets of five.
