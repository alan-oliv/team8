 * Sessions the operator has taken out of the picker with its `✕`.

 * running, its `config.json` is untouched, and another browser still lists it.
 * That is the same rule `stop watching` follows, and for the same reason — the
 * console's only write into `~/.claude` is an inbox entry, so a picker row is
 * never something it may delete.
 *
 * The two are still different actions. `stop watching` stops following the
 * session on screen and deliberately KEEPS its row, marked `running · not
 * watching`, because paging back in is the picker's whole purpose. Hiding
 * removes the row, for the sessions that are only clutter.
