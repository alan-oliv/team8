# Team8

A Claude Code plugin. When a session spawns a **team** of teammates, this puts all
of them side by side in a browser window: every teammate's live transcript, the
shared task list, the mailboxes they talk through, who is burning context, and
what is waiting on you.

## The problem

Spawn more than one agent and the visibility that was fine for a single session
stops scaling: teammates run in separate transcripts with no shared view, tokens
burn toward a context ceiling with nothing to show it, mailbox traffic between
agents has nowhere to be read at a glance, and a permission or plan prompt in a
pane you are not watching just sits there. Coordinating a team by tabbing
between terminals is worse than running one agent alone. This is the cockpit
for a team's actual state, in one screen.

You never start it. The plugin's `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` hooks on the `Agent`
and `Workflow` tools watch for the moment a real team, or a workflow, comes into
existence and start the server themselves, then print the URL into the session
once — before the teammate spawns when possible, falling back to just after it:

```
team8 → http://127.0.0.1:4823/?team=session-98b0b4a7
```

## Six views

These are team mode's. The console has a second mode, chosen by what triggered
the run rather than by a toggle: a dynamic workflow. A workflow subagent never
enters `members[]`, so a workflow is not a team and is not drawn as one — that
mode has no roster, no inboxes, no task list and no composer. Its four views are
**run** (agents grouped by phase), **agents** (the ephemeral roster), **script**
(the persisted script with the resume model drawn on it) and **journal** (each
agent's actual return value, `null` included).

| | |
|---|---|
| **wall** | one transcript column per teammate, lead pinned on the left |
| **overview** | one tile per agent with a context-occupancy bar |
| **comms** | an `everyone` room carrying the whole team's traffic, with per-pair inbox threads below it |
| **tasks** | the shared task list |
| **rail** | a keyboard-navigable agent list with one big transcript |
| **grid** | six panes at once for a wide monitor |

Across the bottom, **NEEDS YOU** collects everything blocked on a human. From any
view you can message a teammate, ask it to wrap up or stop, or answer a permission
prompt without switching back to the terminal.

## Requirements

- **Claude Code with agent teams enabled.** Teams are an experimental feature:
  `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` has to be set (in `~/.claude/settings.json`
  under `env`, or in your shell) or there is nothing for this to show, and
  `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS=1` is what fills the **tasks** view. `/console-setup`
  sets both for you — see below. Being experimental, the on-disk shapes it reads can
  change without notice — the server prints a warning at startup when
  `claude --version` is not the version it was built against.
- **Node 22+** and `curl`, both of which you already have if Claude Code runs.
- macOS or Linux.

## Install

Three steps on a new machine, then restart:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add alan-oliv/team8
claude plugin install team8@team8
# then, inside Claude Code:
/console-setup
```

The plugin ships with its bundle already built, so there is no `npm install` and no
build step on your machine. Everything the console observes travels inside it — all
ten hooks, the launcher, the two slash commands — and needs no configuration.

`/console-setup` is the once-per-machine step for the two things a plugin manifest
has nowhere to put: the `env` vars that turn on agent teams and the task tools, and
`subagentStatusLine`. It checks the machine first, shows you the keys, and writes
only once you say yes. It never touches your `statusLine` and never writes hooks —
see [what is left to install](#what-is-left-to-install-two-env-vars) for why.

`marketplace add` also takes a local path (`claude plugin marketplace add
/path/to/team8`) or any git URL — this repository is its own marketplace.
Prefer the `owner/repo` form: a local directory is copied verbatim, `node_modules`
and all, while a clone brings only what is committed.

**Restart your Claude Code session afterwards.** Hooks and `env` are read once at
session start, so the console will not appear in the session you installed from.

Check it any time with the `/console` slash command (`/team8:console`
if another plugin already owns that name). It reports whether the console is
running, prints its URL, and starts it if a team is live but the server is down.

## It only wakes for a real team, or a workflow

The launcher runs on **every** `Agent` or `Workflow` tool call, so it is written
to be cheap and to do nothing almost every time. For an `Agent` call it reads
`~/.claude/teams/<team>/config.json` and gives up unless that file lists **two
or more members**. A `Workflow` call has no such gate — a run forms no team, so
every one wakes the console and points it at the session that ran it instead.

Ordinary subagents, `Explore`, workflow fan-outs and parallel search agents never
appear in `members[]` — verified during the capture spike, where six workflow
subagents were live and `members[]` still held only the lead. So they cost one
short-lived shell process and nothing else: no server, no window, no message.

Only teammates spawned onto a team, or a workflow's own top-level call, count.

## What it reads and writes

Everything is local. Nothing leaves `127.0.0.1`, and the server refuses
cross-origin requests.

**Reads** (all under `~/.claude`, or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` if you set it):

- `teams/<team>/config.json` — the roster
- `teams/<team>/inboxes/*.json` — the mailboxes
- `projects/**/*.jsonl` and their `*.meta.json` sidecars — teammate transcripts
- `tasks/<team>/*.json` — the shared task list
- `sessions/<lead>.json` — the git branch shown in the header

**Writes:**

- `team8/logs/<team>.jsonl` — its own append-only event log, one
  file per team, so a console started for a second team cannot write over the
  first team's history. Pruned at startup, capped per event kind and, for
  transcript history, per agent, and dropped once nothing has touched it for a
  week. Safe to delete, but only mostly rebuilt from the files above: the
  roster, transcripts, tasks and mail come back on the next sweep, while what
  the hooks push in — the status line, the per-agent substatus, the permission
  and plan cards — exists nowhere else and does not.
- `team8/events.db.migrated-<epoch-ms>` — only if you upgraded
  from a version that kept one shared log. The first start after the upgrade
  folds `team8/events.db` into the per-team logs above — that is
  how your open permission cards, status line and per-agent substatus survive
  the upgrade, since nothing under `~/.claude` can rebuild them — and renames
  the original to this name. Nothing reads it again, it is written once, and it
  is never cleaned up, so delete it whenever you like: once the console has come
  back with your cards and status line intact, it holds nothing you cannot
  already see. Two caveats. If the console reports `events.db is left in place`,
  another console was writing one of the team logs at that moment; start it
  again on its own and it will finish. And if you upgraded from a version older
  still, `events.db` was a SQLite database rather than a log — the console
  reports `recovered 0 row(s)` and renames it aside unread.
- `team8.log` — the detached server's stdout and stderr
- `team8/announced/<team>` — a marker so the URL is printed once
  per team, not once per teammate
- `teams/<team>/inboxes/<agent>.json` — **only** when you act in the UI. Messaging a
  teammate, asking one to wrap up or stop, and requesting a respawn are all just
  entries appended to that teammate's inbox, exactly as the lead would write them.

It does **not** touch `settings.json` when installed as a plugin — the hooks it
needs travel inside the plugin, and `/console-setup` is the only thing that writes
there, only when you ask it to.

The server exits ten minutes after the last team goes away, and immediately on the
lead's `SessionEnd`. Start it with `--read-only` to disable every control route.

### A workflow run has no controls, and cannot have any

The design names two, `skip agent` and `stop run`, and neither ships. Not
because a server route is missing — because there is nothing for a route to
call.

A dynamic workflow runs inside the Claude Code session process. Both verbs are
an `AbortController.abort()` and a status write against an in-memory task
registry, and the only callers are that session's own terminal UI: `x` on a
running run in the task list, skip and retry in its detail panel. Nothing on
disk drives them. `journal.jsonl` and the run snapshot this console reads are
outputs, and the journal is read back only at the start of a
`Workflow({ resumeFromRunId })` replay.

The one live channel another process can open is the per-session unix socket
advertised in `sessions/<pid>.json`. It accepts three things: a prompt for the
session's queue, a rename, and delivery receipts. There is no workflow verb —
and the prompt is the wrong shape anyway, because a queued prompt is read at a
turn boundary and the run is happening inside the tool call that turn is
waiting on. `stop the run` would arrive after the run it was meant to stop. A
signal to the session's pid would end the whole session and every teammate in
it, which is a different verb with a different blast radius.

So the console watches a workflow and never touches it. This is the refusal the
design makes for `Send now` on the in-flight badge: a control whose only effect
is its own highlight teaches a capability that does not exist, and it does it at
the moment the operator most needs to trust the screen. Checked against Claude
Code 2.1.231 — if a run-control call ever ships, this is the paragraph to
delete.

## What is left to install: two env vars

The plugin carries its own hooks. All ten observation events — `PreToolUse`,
`PostToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Notification`, `Stop`,
`SubagentStop`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `PreCompact` — are registered in the
plugin's `plugin/hooks/hooks.json` and fire from there, so **permission cards, plan
approvals and tool activity work on a bare install with no `settings.json` edit at
all.** Timeouts are in seconds, and the hooks cost one refused connection each
while the console is not running.

Two things have no plugin-manifest equivalent, because Claude Code has nowhere for
a plugin to put them:

- **`env`** — `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`, without which there are no
  teams to show, and `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS`, which fills the **tasks** view
- **`subagentStatusLine`** — each teammate's current tool, in its header

Run **`/console-setup`** once per machine for those two and nothing else. It ships
with the plugin: it checks the machine can run the console, reads your
`settings.json`, shows you what it would add, and writes only once you say yes.

`settings.json` is the right home for them precisely because it is per-machine: a
shell export only reaches sessions started from that shell, not ones an editor or
launcher spawns.

### Your status line is yours

The console's own `statusLine` command ends in `printf ''` — it draws nothing,
because its job is only to POST the payload. Written over an existing status line
(`ccstatusline`, `starship`, anything custom) it would leave you with a blank bar,
so **the install never takes that key unless it is empty.** If you already have a
status line, it is left exactly as it is and you give up two readouts: the
rate-limit gauge, and the lead's cost and context in the header. Everything else —
transcripts, tasks, mail, permission cards, per-agent current tool — is unaffected.

Want both? Ask `/console-setup` for it explicitly and it will chain the two, POSTing
the payload to the console before handing it to your own command. It will not do
that on its own.

`/console-setup` also reverses itself — ask it to remove what it added and it drops
only the keys it installed, and puts both `env` vars back the way it found them. The
hooks are not its business either way: they come and go with `claude plugin
install` / `uninstall`.

<details>
<summary>Without the plugin, from a clone</summary>

```bash
npm install
npm run setup            # prints the block it would write
npm run setup -- --yes   # writes it to ~/.claude/settings.json
```

This is the no-plugin path, so it writes the ten hooks into `settings.json`
as well as the env vars and `subagentStatusLine`. **Do not run it if you have the
plugin installed** — the hooks would fire twice, once from each copy. It merges
into your existing hooks rather than replacing them, follows the same rule about
your status line (it takes the key only when nothing else holds it), and
`npm run uninstall -- --yes` puts everything back. Whatever those `env` vars were
before is stashed in `~/.claude/team8.backup.json` and restored on
uninstall.

</details>

## The design, and everything that isn't source

The design bundle, the original plan and spec, and the manual acceptance script
live in a sibling repository, `agents-team-ui-docs`, which is not
version-controlled. None of it is the product: the design folder in particular
is a re-pulled mirror of a Claude Design project, so versioning it here recorded
someone else's edit history alongside this one.

If you are implementing against the design, read
`../agents-team-ui-docs/design/CHANGELOG.md` first — it is newest-first and says
what changed and why, which is what you want when the console already exists.

## Developing

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # vite on 5173 proxying the server on 4823
npm test           # vitest
npm run typecheck
```

### Everything that ships lives in `plugin/`

```
plugin/                      the entire installed artifact, 1.3M
├─ .claude-plugin/plugin.json
├─ bin/  commands/  hooks/
└─ dist/                     committed on purpose, see below
```

Nothing else in this repository is installed. That boundary is load-bearing:
`claude plugin install` runs `npm install` when it finds a `package.json` at the
plugin root, dev dependencies and all — which is how an earlier layout put 141M
on disk for a console that needs 1.3M. Keeping `package.json` and `src/` at the
repo root, outside `plugin/`, is what stops that.

**`plugin/dist/` is committed** for the same reason: a plugin is just files, and
nothing builds on the user's machine. Rebuild before publishing:

```bash
npm run build
git add plugin/dist
```

`npm run build` is wired to the `prepare` script, so a plain `npm install` in this
repo refreshes it for you. The build is deterministic: if nothing in `src/`
changed, `git status` stays clean.

The server has **no runtime dependencies** either. Everything it needs is bundled
by esbuild into `plugin/dist/server/index.js`, which is why `plugin/` runs from a
bare copy with no `node_modules` in sight — verified by running it from a directory
containing nothing else.
